        <h1>A Music Junkie's Guide to Summer on Long Island</h1>
        <p>For those born and raised on Long Island, summertime always brings late nights at Revolution shows, scorching days at Jones Beach music festivals and relaxing vibes seeing friends perform at Mr. Beery’s. The fish-shaped areas making up Nassau and Suffolk stretch off of New York City- a major hub known for summer festivals like Governor’s Ball and this year’s new festival, Panorama. But what isn’t known is that the island is also doused in its own unique concert going experiences that last all Summer long. These shows span from homegrown hits like Taking Back Sunday at Jones Beach Theatre to up-and-coming acts like Moon Tooth playing at a local music club. 

“There is a variety of genres being tapped into out here,” said Kyler Sane, a Long Island musician whose fronted metal bands, Reluctant Mortem and The Muckrakers. “No one genre is overwhelmingly popular. This creates plenty of opportunities considering there are so many musicians out here.” Looking at the following spider graph it is clear that certain venues play across a wide spectrum of genres. A band like Sane’s might be seen playing at Amityville Music Hall because of it’s abundance of heavier music spanning across the metal and hardcore genres. At the same time, venues like The Emporium or 89 North, both in Patchogue, have also been known to play their fair share of metal and hardcore shows. 

“We look for venues that have great sound, a big stage because we like to have a strong stage presence, and a room that would fit our current draw. We don’t like to overshoot the venue and waste any space,” said Jake Salazar, Long Island musician and frontman of the alternative/punk band, Approaching Troy. He continued to discuss how important it is for a band to earn the trust and loyalty of the crowds Long Island offers. “Once you do, they’re the most loyal group of fans you’ll ever have,” Salazar said. “Look at Taking Back Sunday, still killing it in Long Island years after their biggest albums.” 

As seen on the map, Jones Beach is a beacon of concerts and offers 30 this summer alone. This year offers radio festivals like KTUphoria and the BLI Summer Jam, notable tours like the Taste of Chaos and Vans Warped Tour, as well as anniversaries and annual classics like Jimmy Buffet. Jones Beach comes alive almost every night of the summer with concert goers and tail gaters who simply sit by their cars and enjoy a beer while listening to the music.

          <h3>Booking Long Island</h3>
          <title>Blacklist Collective</title>
          <p>Founded this year, Blacklist Collective started as an effort to push for honest, genuine booking that recognizes the talents of local acts and puts them together at venues such as Revolution, Amityville Music Hall and 89 North. “It began after a few friends of mine from Older Than Oceans (Long Island punk outfit) were discussing some of the things that were causing our scene to whither,” said Louis Navas, founder of the booking company. He went on to describe his dissent towards booking and promotional companies that are more focused on financial gain than they are putting together the exciting shows he has been going to all his life. He continued by saying how Long Island concerts have more to offer than just music. When fans go out to see a show they are contributing to the ever growing scene. “A lot of us (musicians) are misfits in our homes, schools, jobs, etc. and have been lucky enough to find a place where we have community,” Navas said. “That’s the Long Island flavor.” </p>
